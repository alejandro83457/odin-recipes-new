      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Peach Topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>4 peaches, sliced</li>
      <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper and set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift flour, 4 1/2 teaspoons sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a
        bowl. Rub in butter with your fingers until mixture resembles course
        crumbs. Stir in 1/2 cup milk and mix into a soft dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide dough into 4 equal parts and flatten each part into a 2-inch
        diameter disc. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with 1
        tablespoon milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix remaining 1 teaspoon sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle
        the top of each biscuit with cinnamon sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits begin to brown on the edges,
        about 12 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, whisk water, sugar, cornstarch, and cinnamon together in a
        medium saucepan over medium heat. Add sliced peaches and cook until
        sauce begins to thicken, stirring occasionally to coat all of the
        peaches. Remove from heat and cool.
      </li>
      <li>Whip heavy cream in a bowl until stiff peaks form.</li>
      <li>
        Cut each biscuit in half horizontally. Place the bottoms on a serving
        plate. Add a dollop of whipped cream, top with 1/4 of the peaches,
        another dollop of whipped cream, and the biscuit top. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
